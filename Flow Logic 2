t a high level, you need two pieces of logic:

Joining all the time‐series back to the bond metadata

Within each date, grouping by (sector, rating) and “neutralizing” your raw signal

1. Joining the tables
Suppose you want, for a given rebalance date d, to fetch:

bond static info (sector, rating)

today’s market data (clean_price, duration, etc.)

today’s ETF‐flow signal (raw_par_flow_6m, etc.)

You can do this with a three‐way join:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT
  b.bond_id,
  b.sector,
  b.rating,
  m.clean_price,
  m.duration_oas,
  s.raw_par_flow_6m,
  s.dur_adj_flow_6m
FROM bond_master AS b
JOIN bond_market_data AS m
  ON m.bond_id = b.bond_id
  AND m.trade_date = :d
JOIN daily_signals AS s
  ON s.bond_id = b.bond_id
  AND s.signal_date = :d
You’d parameterize :d with each rebalance date (e.g. every business day or month‐end).

2. Sector/Rating Neutralization
Once you have, for date d, a table of bonds with their “raw” signals, you neutralize by subtracting the cross‐sectional (sector, rating) mean. In SQL this looks like:

sql
Copy
Edit
WITH joined AS (
  -- (the query above)
),
grouped AS (
  SELECT
    bond_id,
    sector,
    rating,
    raw_par_flow_6m,
    dur_adj_flow_6m,
    -- compute the mean per (sector, rating) group
    AVG(raw_par_flow_6m)  OVER (PARTITION BY sector, rating) AS mean_raw,
    AVG(dur_adj_flow_6m)  OVER (PARTITION BY sector, rating) AS mean_dur
  FROM joined
)
SELECT
  bond_id,
  sector,
  rating,
  -- subtract the group mean to get a "neutralized" signal
  raw_par_flow_6m - mean_raw  AS neutral_raw_flow,
  dur_adj_flow_6m - mean_dur  AS neutral_dur_flow
FROM grouped;
What’s happening?
JOINED CTE pulls in each bond’s static and time‐series data for date d.

grouped CTE uses window functions to compute the average signal within each (sector, rating) slice.

The final SELECT subtracts out that group mean, so that after neutralization, each sector/rating bucket has cross‐sectional mean zero.

Why this matters
Cross‐sectional comparability
Bonds in “Financials / BBB” tend to have very different flow magnitudes than those in “Industrials / BB.” By sector/rating neutralizing, you ensure you aren’t simply overweighting one risk bucket.

Signal pureness
Your contraflow or duration‐adjusted flow now represents a within‐group deviation from peers—precisely what you want to long/short, not the level‐driven sector effects.

In code (Python/pandas) the same logic is:

python
Copy
Edit
df = joined_df.copy()
# compute group means
group_means = df.groupby(['sector','rating'])['raw_par_flow_6m','dur_adj_flow_6m'].transform('mean')
# subtract
df['neutral_raw_flow'] = df['raw_par_flow_6m'] - group_means['raw_par_flow_6m']
df['neutral_dur_flow'] = df['dur_adj_flow_6m'] - group_means['dur_adj_flow_6m']
