Let's address this. The core issue is that while holdings data (etf_holdings) is low-frequency (monthly at best), the AP activity driving create/redeem is high-frequency (daily). We can infer this daily activity using daily ETF data.

Here is the revised, more sophisticated approach.

The Core Idea: Inferring Daily Flows
We can't see daily holdings changes, but we can see their result: changes in an ETF's shares outstanding.

Daily Create/Redeem Flow (Inferred):
CreateRedeem_Flow_USD(e, t) = (SharesOutstanding(e, t) - SharesOutstanding(e, t-1)) * NAV(e, t-1)

If this value is positive, there was a net creation (inflow).
If this value is negative, there was a net redemption (outflow).
This gives us a daily dollar flow for each ETF. We can then apportion this daily flow to the underlying bonds using the last known holdings.

Revised Schema and Workflow for Daily Signals
This requires adding a new daily signal table and modifying our workflow.

Part 1: Schema Modifications
We need a new table to store daily, inferred signals.

New Table: signals_daily
Description: Stores signals calculated daily, primarily focused on capturing the high-frequency create/redeem arbitrage effects.
Primary Key: (date, bond_id)
Columns:
date: DATE, PK
bond_id: INT, PK, FOREIGN KEY -> bonds_static
Inferred Daily Flow Signals:
inferred_alloc_flow_usd: DECIMAL(20, 4) -- The core daily create/redeem flow apportioned to this bond.
premium_discount_bps: DECIMAL(10, 4) -- etfs_daily.market_price vs nav_price.
etf_volume_zscore: DECIMAL(8, 4) -- Z-score of today's ETF volume vs. 90-day average.
Daily Arbitrage Pressure Score:
daily_ap_pressure_score: DECIMAL(18, 9) -- A score combining the above three metrics.
Long-Term Flow Context (Carried Forward):
last_known_irecon_flow: DECIMAL(18, 9) -- The value from the last monthly calculation.
last_known_wrecon_flow: DECIMAL(18, 9) -- The value from the last monthly calculation.
Part 2: Revised Dual-Frequency Workflow
Your system now needs to operate on two clocks: monthly for deep reconstitution analysis and daily for tactical arbitrage signals.

A. Monthly "Strategic" Cycle (Run on last day of month t)

Purpose: To calculate the slow-moving, structural signals that require holdings data.
Process:
When new etf_holdings data is filed, calculate the Index Reconstitution (IReFlow) and Weight Reconstitution (WReFlow) flows.
Store these values in the signals_monthly table.
These values represent the "potential energy" for price reversions over the coming month.
B. Daily "Tactical" Cycle (Run every day t)

Purpose: To capture the daily create/redeem arbitrage pressure.
Process: For each ETF e:
Calculate the inferred daily flow: daily_flow_usd = (shares_t - shares_{t-1}) * nav_{t-1}.
For each bond i held by ETF e (using the last known holdings from etf_holdings):
Get the bond's last known weight w(i, e).
Apportion the flow: inferred_alloc_flow_usd(i, t) += daily_flow_usd * w(i, e).
Calculate the premium_discount_bps and etf_volume_zscore.
Combine these into a daily_ap_pressure_score.
Populate the signals_daily table.
The Unified, Actionable Strategy
Now your final composite score can be a combination of both high-frequency and low-frequency signals.

Final Composite Score (Calculated Daily)
On any given day t, for each bond i:

Fetch Strategic Context: Look up the last_known_irecon_flow and last_known_wrecon_flow for bond i from the signals_monthly table. This is the structural reason a bond might be mispriced.
Fetch Tactical Trigger: Get the daily_ap_pressure_score for bond i from today's signals_daily calculation. This is the immediate catalyst.
Combine them:

Copy
Final_Score(i, t) = w_strategic * rank(last_known_irecon_flow + last_known_wrecon_flow) 
                  + w_tactical * rank(daily_ap_pressure_score)
Why this is a superior model:

It separates cause and effect. The reconstitution flow is the underlying cause of potential mispricing. The daily AP pressure is the effect and the immediate catalyst for price moves.
It's event-driven. A bond might have a huge potential for reversion due to a large IReFlow last month (high strategic score), but you might only enter the trade on a day when you see a spike in ETF premium and volume (high tactical score), indicating that the reversion is actively happening.
It's more realistic. It acknowledges the different frequencies of the available data and uses each piece of information appropriately.
This dual-frequency approach is more complex to implement but is far more robust and better reflects the true market dynamics you are trying to capture. It correctly identifies that the create/redeem flow is a daily phenomenon that should be modeled as such.
