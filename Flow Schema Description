bond_master
– Static reference data about every bond in your universe.
– Holds identifiers (CUSIP/FIGI), issuer, sector/rating, total par outstanding, settlement convention, coupon, maturity.
– Used to join all time‑series data back to the right bond and to apply sector‑ or rating‑based neutralization.

bond_market_data
– Daily price and liquidity metrics for each bond.
– Fields like clean price, bid–ask spread, effective duration, and ADV (average daily volume) let you compute yields, DV01, filters, and next‑day returns.
– Feeds both signal construction (e.g. duration adjustment) and backtest PnL.

etf_daily_flows
– Daily snapshots of each ETF’s bond holdings plus explicit breakdown of create/redeem flows into “allocation” vs. “reconstitution.”
– Also carries ETF AUM, NAV, price, and trading volume.
– This underpins your daily par‑flow, allocation‑flow, recon‑flow and the arbitrage sensitivity term

daily_signals
– Pre‑computed “rolling” signals on each rebalance date (often daily).
– Contains raw six‑month par‑flow, duration‑adjusted flow, decomposed components, arbitrage term, and directional flow.
– By storing these once per day, you avoid re‑running heavy window aggregations on the fly.

tracking_error
– A log of realized tracking error vs. your benchmark, at whatever cadence you choose (daily or weekly).
– Allows you to monitor TE against your target and trigger alerts or risk‑control actions if you breach limits.

daily_portfolio
– Your actual backtest ledger: for each bond and each weight date, it records the final position weight, the next‑day return, and the resulting PnL.
– Enables calculation of strategy returns, turnover, drawdowns, and realized tracking error.
